In my presentation, I discussed artificial intelligence and how significant it is for development of technology and the growth of humans. 
Specifically, I did a brief overview of its past and present and made assumptions of its future based on research. Artificial intelligence 
has been around for a couple of decades and is integrated into all of our lives in certain ways. Artificial intelligence is a widely 
accepted innovation with benefits that outweigh its few debatable detriments.
